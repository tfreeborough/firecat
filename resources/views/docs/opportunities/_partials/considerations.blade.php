                Considerations are part of the review process for any given opportunity, you will first see the considerations table
                when the opportunity is set to <i>`In Review`</i>. Considerations are no required in order for an opportunity to
                be converted to a deal, but stand as a set of recommendations for vendors to check over before any deal is created.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for an opportunity to be converted, considerations must be checked off by associated members of an opportunity,
                this will also update the activity log. Any associated member may, if they choose so undo a consideration which is also
                reflected in the activity log.

                    In a future update, custom considerations will be implemented, allowing vendors to eliminate unnecessary
                    considerations that they do not require.
